<h3>
Hello! I'm Yating Yang, a current graduate student at <a href="https://moody.utexas.edu">Moody College </a>, UT Austin, majoring in Communication Studies. I got both my B.A. (major in communication) and my B.S. (major in finance) from Renmin University of China in 2016.
</h3>

<h2>
My current research interests include health communication, dyadic communication, identity, and equality. I am particularly interested in studying the role of communication in changing environments. I believe the constructive power of communication and enjoy the journey of exploring the unknown and contributing to discipline development and practical application of communication.

More details about me.
I have an adorable cat who looks like a raccoon (see picture in the right). I also enjoy jogging since it can relax me when I'm stressed out. If you also like jogging, welcome to be my Strava friend! I try my best to sustain a work-life balance and sincerely appreciate every little good thing in life. The light blue sky and fresh air can provide me the energy to pursue my academic interests, like a cup of fresh coffee. I have a partner who can provide me with mental comfort. Considering the gap between sending and perceiving information, I appreciate that we didn't have a lot of fight! I enjoy what I have and look forward to what the future has in store for me. Have a good day!
